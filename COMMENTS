You pretty much covered everything for board and ship pretty well.
Maybe there was a comment but I missed it, but is shipDirection supposed to help with
how to place the ship on the board? And location is meant to be the back of the ship?

Are there default sizes for these ships? Should they be hardcoded with #define
statements?
