Jacob Lubben comments:

In bool Board::placeShip:
Work off of exclusively 2 orientations, north and east. Then you should be able to just work with negatives for more condensed code.

In Board.h Ship.h:
Everything should be contained inside a class. You have structs outside. Fix that.

Other than that, it seemed like clear and concise code.
